Then, wash the horsegram thoroughly and soak it for at least 30 minutes. If you have the time, you can choose to soak it for an hour.",
      "Once the soaking is complete, drain the water from the horsegram and transfer it to a pressure cooker. Add a couple of tomatoes, 2 cups water to cook the horsegram, and a small amount of oil. Castor oil is recommended for achieving a soft and tender consistency, but if you don’t have it, you can omit it or use any vegetable oil of your preference. Cover the pressure cooker and cook for 12 minutes, disregarding the number of whistles. Afterward, remove the cooker from the heat and allow the pressure to settle naturally. Open the cooker and remove the tomatoes, discard the tomato skins, and set them aside. Drain the broth and also set it aside.",
      "Note",
      "The broth, tomatoes, and a small portion of the cooked horsegram will be used for making saaru/rasam, while the remaining cooked horsegram will be used for making sundal.",

Stir for a moment, and then add the chopped onions. Sauté for a few minutes until the onions are soft. Next, add the cooked horsegram, salt, and freshly shredded coconut. Mix everything together well and cook for a minute. Finally, sprinkle a generous amount of coriander leaves over the sundal to finish.",
      "For the saaru, heat oil in a pan and add cumin seeds and chopped garlic. Add the curry leaves, dry red chillies, black pepper, and a small piece of tamarind. Roast briefly and then add a couple of tablespoons of the cooked horsegram to thicken the saaru. Add the cooked tomatoes (skin removed), a little coconut, turmeric powder, and some coriander leaves. Cook for a minute, then remove from heat and set it aside to cool. Grind this mixture with a little water to create a coarse paste, which will serve as our saaru masala.",
      "Now, let’s temper the rasam. Heat oil in a pan and add cumin seeds, mustard seeds, curry leaves, and dried red chillies. Allow the mustard seeds to crackle. Add the horsegram broth and the ground masala paste. Rinse the mixie with 1.5 cups of water and add it to the pan. Season with salt, and taste and adjust the seasoning if necessary. Bring the saaru to a boil, and finish by sprinkling a generous amount of coriander leaves over it.",

Make sure to stop grinding when the consistency of the powder resembles a rava / semolina-like texture. Set aside. Take a kadhai and add little oil. When the oil is hot, add the split urad dal, mustard seeds, red chillies, and sliced garlic. Saute for a few seconds so the mustard seeds crackle. Add the onions and saute for a few minutes till the onions are soft. Once the onions are soft, add the cleaned and washed moringa leaves. Saute for 2-3 minutes till the leaves wilt completely. Once the leaves are wilted, add the salt and the roasted powder. Cook for a few seconds. Do not cook for long after adding the roasted powder. The crunchy texture of the powder along with the greens tastes really good when served with rice."

Once all the ingredients are roasted and golden, remove and set aside on a plate to cool. Leave the remaining oil in the pan. To the pan, add the onions, tomatoes and the bottle gourd. I like to use peeled and diced bottle gourd. Add a small piece of tamarind, salt, turmeric powder and asafoetida. Mix well. Cover the pan with a lid and cook on a low flame for about 10 minutes till the bottle gourd is soft and mushy. At this stage add the coconut and the coriander leaves. Cook for a minute. Do not cook for long after adding coriander leaves. Take a heavy-duty mixie jar and add the roasted lentil chilli mixture. Grind to a smooth paste. Add little water while grinding. Once the mixture is ground to a smooth paste, add the cooked veggie mixture to the same jar and grind again. Grind to a coarse texture. Do not grind to a fine paste. Finally, add little jaggery and pulse once in the mixie. The texture of the chutney should be coarse. Remove the chutney to a bowl and set aside. Take a small kadai and add little oil. Once the oil is hot, add the split urad dal and the mustard seeds. Let the mustard seeds crackle. Add the curry leaves and the dried red chillies. Roast for a few seconds. Add the tempering to the chutney and mix well. Serve with rice and a little ghee. Enjoy!"

Marinate the chicken for at least 30 minutes in the refrigerator. You can marinate for up to an hour. Line the chicken on the air fryer tray. Do not crowd the tray. Make sure there is enough space for the hot air to rotate so the chicken cooks evenly inside the air fryer. Fry in batches as required. Air fry at 200°Celsius / 400°Fahrenheit for 14-15 minutes. Turn the chicken pieces after 6-7 minutes so it cooks evenly on both sides. Continue to fry for another 6-7 minutes. The frying time will slightly vary depending on the size of the cut chicken piece. If the pieces are really small, it will take few minutes less. After air frying, let the chicken rest for a few minutes so the masala sticks to the chicken. Take a small tadka pan and roast some green chillies and curry leaves. Once the curry leaves crisp up, add the tempering to the chicken. Serve hot."

      "Take a pressure cooker (preferably 5-6 liters). Add oil to the cooker. Add the chopped onions and curry leaves. Saute for 5-6 minutes till the onions are light brown. Adding lots of onions will give body and thickness to the kuzhambu. Add the tomatoes and the salt. Cook for a minute. Add the red chilli powder, turmeric powder, black pepper powder, coriander powder, and meat masala powder. Saute everything for a minute. Add the ground masala paste. Wash the mixie with water and add to the cooker. Add about 1.5 cups of water. Mix well. Add the mutton. Bone-in mutton is preferred while making kuzhambu as the bones will make the curry very flavourful. Cover the pan and cook for 20 minutes on a low flame. Do not worry about the number of whistles. Cooking on a low flame is key so the ingredients do not scorch at the bottom. After 20 minutes, remove the cooker from the heat and wait for the pressure to settle. Open the cooker and check if the meat is cooked and tender. If the meat is still hard, cook for a few minutes more. Finally add a few sprigs of curry leaves, coriander leaves, and black pepper powder. Simmer for a minute. Mutton kuzhambu is ready. This kuzhambu is best served with idli or rice. This tastes good with rice-based dishes. Enjoy!"

Take four pieces of cooked parottas or chapati and add them to a mixie or a food processor. Blitz it several times so the parottas are shredded into small pieces. Do not grind fine.

Add half a cup of unpolished white whole urad dal, a quarter teaspoon of fenugreek seeds – fenugreek aids in better fermentation and finally half a cup of poha, ie aval. The addition of aval will make the paniyarams very fluffy.",
      "Wash everything in water once or twice in water and get rid of the starchy water as much as possible. All the ingredients can be soaked together for this recipe. No need to soak separately. Soak everything for about 4 hours. The grains should have absorbed the water and should have swollen up after about 4 hours. Drain the soaking water completely as millets have anti-nutrients called phytates and soaking can reduce them to a certain extent. So get rid of the soaking water by draining them on a colander. Grind the drained grains in a heavy-duty mixie to a smooth paste. Add about two cups of water while grinding. Grind in batches and do not crowd the mixie. The batter should be smooth in texture. Add a teaspoon of salt to the ground batter and mix well to combine. Mix well so the salt is distributed evenly. I like to salt the batter soon after its ground as it will keep away unwanted bacteria while fermenting. Use a big bowl as the batter will rise during fermentation.",
      "After mixing, cover the bowl with a lid and allow it to ferment in a draft-free place at room temperature. Let it ferment for about 6-8 hours. It might take a little longer if you live in a cold place. If you live in a cold place, ferment inside an oven with its pilot light alone turned on so it will keep the oven at ideal temperature.",
      "After fermenting, the batter should look very bubbly and should have risen well. Mix the batter with a spatula. Our batter is now ready. At this stage, the batter can be stored in a refrigerator and used within a couple of days.",
      "To make the masala sola paniyarams, we shall make a masala paste. Take a small mixie jar and add in some shallots, fresh shredded coconut, curry leaves, cumin seeds and green chillies. Grind to a coarse paste. Grinding the mixture to a coarse paste is important so the paniyarams have a little bit of texture to them while eating.",
      "Take about half of the prepared paniyaram batter in a bowl and add the masala paste. Once you add the masala paste, the batter needs to be used immediately and it does not store well. So add the masala paste only to the amount of batter that you may require. Half of the prepared paniyaram batter added to this masala paste will make about 20-22 small paniyarams. Add some chopped coriander leaves and mix everything well to combine. Our masala paniyaram batter is now ready.",
      "Heat a paniyarakkal on medium flame and grease it with Indian-style sesame oil. Indian-style sesame oil is untoasted and has a very unique flavour. Peanut oil can also be used for making these paniyarams. Once the griddle is hot, add little scoops of the batter to the pan. The batter will rise a little while it cooks. After adding the batter, reduce the flame of the stove to low and cook for two minutes. The paniyarams take time to cook. If you hurry, the outside will be brown and crispy but the inside will still be raw. So cook on a low flame. After a couple of minutes, turn the paniyarams and cook on the other side for a couple of more minutes.",
      "Our paniyarams are done if both sides are cooked golden. If you are cooking for guests at home, you can also sprinkle little ghee just before removing the paniyarams from the griddle. Serve the paniyarams hot with coconut chutney or kaara chutney. Enjoy."

After a couple of minutes, try to separate the balls with a spatula if they are sticking to each other. Also do not overcrowd the kadai. Fry in batches. Let the balls fry till they are golden.

Keep sauteing once in a while to avoid scorching at the bottom. Add little water while cooking if necessary. The tomatoes should be cooked to a mushy texture.

Wash the mixie with half a cup of water and back to the pan. Simmer on a low flame for a couple of minutes. Add little sugar to balance the taste of the gravy. Finally add little butter and mix well to combine. Finish off with a generous sprinkling of coriander leaves.",

These paniyarams need to be cooked on a low medium flame. Cook for a minute on each side so the paniyarams cook evenly and are cooked thoroughly. After a minute flip the paniyarams and cook on the other side. If you want a very rich paniyaram, you can sprinkle little ghee at this stage. Cook on the other side till golden. Make sure to cook on both sides till the paniyarams look golden. Once the paniyarams are roasted and golden, remove them from the pan. These paniyarams can be eaten on their own or served with a spicy kaara chutney.",

Saute on a low flame till the dal roasts and becomes golden. Remove the roasted lentil mixture to a plate. Set that aside. In the same pan, add a little more oil. Add in some roughly chopped garlic, a sprig of fresh curry leaves, and the chopped beetroot. I have chopped them today. You can also grate them and add. Keeping the cut pieces small helps cook the beets faster. Add in the salt and a small marble-sized piece of tamarind. Mix well so the oil coats the beetroot uniformly. Cover the pan with a lid and cook on a low flame for about five minutes. The beetroots will be half-cooked at this stage. Half cooking the beetroot is enough for this recipe.",
      "Add in a little asafoetida and the fresh shredded coconut. Cook for a minute. Our beetroot mixture is now ready.",
      "Take a heavy-duty mixie or a blender and add the roasted and cooled lentil mixture. Add the beetroot mixture. At this stage add the paaledu – the milk cream. The paaledu makes the thogayal very rich and vibrant in taste. Grind everything to a smooth paste. Add little water while grinding if necessary. The paste should be ground to a thick smooth texture. Set aside.",
      "Now let’s make a simple tempering for the thogayal. Add oil to a small Kadai. Add in the mustard seeds, curry leaves and dried red chillies. Saute for a few seconds. Let the mustard seeds crackle. Add the roasted and skinned peanuts to the pan and saute for a few seconds more. The roasted peanuts add a nice textural crunch to the thogayal.",
      "Add the tempering on top of the thogayal. Our fantastic beetroot thogayal is now ready. Serve the thogayal with hot rice and enjoy."

      "Take a small mixie jar and add in the Indian sambar onion shallots, garlic, ginger, green chillies, fennel seeds, cinnamon, star anise, cloves, cardamom, kalpasi, and couple of tablespoons of water. Grind everything to a smooth paste. The paste should be ground fine. Set aside. Take a pressure cooker and add in the oil and the ghee. Add in the bay leaves, maratti moggu, a small piece of cinnamon, and the sliced onions. Saute for a few minutes till the onions are soft. No need to brown the onions for this recipe. Add in the sliced tomatoes and the ground paste, and the salt. Mix well to combine. Cover the cooker with a lid and cook on a low flame for a few minutes till the tomatoes are mushy. The tomatoes should be well cooked and soft. Add the chicken meat. Chicken thighs are preferred for this recipe. and half a cup of water. Mix everything well to combine. Cover the cooker with its lid and cook for about two whistles. It should take about 3-4 minutes on medium flame. After two whistles, remove from heat and wait for the pressure to settle. While the chicken is cooking, let’s soak the rice. We are using seeraga samba rice today. The short-grained rice adds a nice aroma to the biryani. Wash and soak the rice for about 20 minutes. Once the pressure in the cooker settles, open the cooker and keep the cooker back on the stove. Add in the coconut milk. I added a cup of water. There is some gravy left in the cooker. The rice to liquid ratio is 1 cup rice to 1.5 cups water. If in doubt, measure the gravy in the cooker after cooking the chicken and add the water accordingly. Add the whole green chillies, coriander leaves, and mint leaves. The whole green chillies are only for flavour and not for the heat. So keep the green chillies whole. Bring everything to a boil. Add the soaked and drained rice to the pressure cooker. Add the juice of a lime. Mix everything well. Place a cut banana leaf on top of the rice mixture. The banana leaf is optional but gives a fantastic aroma to the biryani. Cover the cooker with its lid and cook for about two whistles. After two whistles, remove from heat and wait for the pressure to settle. Open the cooker. Remove the banana leaf and gently mix to fluff up the rice."

If you cannot get hold of shallots, regular onions can also be used but first preference would be for shallots as they are sweet, mild and are perfect for the stew.",

Add in the green chillies – adjust the green chillies according to your taste, add in the fennel seeds and little water to grind. Grind the mixture to a really fine paste.",

Cover the pan with a lid and cook the mixture for about 3-4 minutes on a low flame. The cashew paste must be cooked by this time and the gravy should look very creamy. Add in the salt.",

      "Take about 4 hard boiled eggs and make small gashes for the stew to penetrate into the eggs. You can keep the eggs as whole or halve them. It’s totally up to you. I like to keep the eggs whole. Add the eggs to the pan. Add in a cup of coconut milk along. Canned coconut milk can also be used for this recipe. If using home made coconut milk, use thick coconut milk. Mix well to combine. Let it simmer for a couple of minutes.",
      "In the meantime, let’s make a tempering for the stew. Heat ghee in a small tempering kadai. Add in the sliced shallots and the curry leaves. Roast them in ghee on a medium flame till golden. Once the shallots are golden, switch off the flame. With the flame switched off, add in the black pepper powder. Saute for a few seconds for the pepper powder to become aromatic. Add in the tempering to the stew.",

If the pineapple is not very sweet, you might need to add a little bit more sugar. Add in the water and mix well to combine. We will be cooking this mixture on a low flame for about 15 minutes. It’s important to cook on a low flame so the pineapple and banana cook soft and flavourful. Mix once in a while so the mixture does not scorch at the bottom. Add little water if the mixture looks dry. After 15 minutes, the pineapple and bananas should be cooked to a soft texture. Mash the mixture using a potato masher. Make sure there are small bits left behind for the texture. The pineapple nendram masala is now cooked. Taste the masala and adjust for salt or sugar at this stage if necessary. At this stage, let’s make a tempering for the pineapple nendram masala. Heat coconut oil in a small kadai. Add in a few broken cashews to the oil. Roast on a low flame for a few seconds. Add in the mustard seeds, some fresh curry leaves, and some dried red chillies. Let the mustard seeds crackle and the curry leaves become crisp. Add the tempering to the pineapple nendram masala. Mix well to combine. Our pineapple nendram masala is ready. This relish can be stored in the refrigerator for up to a week. Serve as an accompaniment for a traditional south indian lunch."

Fry the cashews on a low flame till golden. Once golden, remove the cashews from the stove and add it to our payasam.",

Once the shallots are lite golden in colour, add in the red chilli powder, turmeric powder, coriander powder and curry masala powder. I have used readymade curry masala powder for this recipe. Saute for a few seconds for the spice powders to get toasted in oil.",
      "In the meantime, add a couple of roughly chopped tomatoes to a mixie. Add in a pod of country garlic. If you do not have country garlic, regular garlic will work too. add in the ginger, chopped green chillies and little fennel seeds. Grind this mixture to a smooth paste.",
      "Add this ground paste to the pan. Saute for three to four minutes till the mixture is dry. Add in the cooked beans along with the water. Remember that we added half salt while cooking the beans and so the kuruma will be half salted now. Mix well to combine.",
      "While the kuruma is simmering, we will make a coconut masala paste.",
      "Take a mixie jar and add in the fresh shredded coconut. Add in the cashews. Add in the poppy seeds. Soak the poppy seeds in little hot water for five minutes so it’s easy to grind. Add in a couple of cloves and a small piece of cinnamon. Add enough water and grind to a smooth paste.",
      "It’s important that the paste be ground to a smooth texture so our kuruma will be creamy. Add in the ground coconut masala paste to the pan. Wash the mixie with little water and add back to the pan. Add in a little salt. Mix well to combine. Cook on a low flame for about 10 – 12 minutes. Saute once in a while. If the kuruma feels very thick while simmering, add little hot water to adjust the consistency.",
      "Once the kuruma has cooked well, Add in a little sugar to balance the flavours. The sugar will not sweeten the kuruma but nicely round the flavours of the dish. Add in juice of half a lime at this stage and switch off the flame. Finish with a generous sprinkling of coriander leaves. Our fantastic Madurai butter bean kuruma is ready. This can be served with Idli, Dosai or Chapati."

      "I am using rakthashali, a variety of unpolished red rice, for making the khichdi today. Any unpolished red rice or brown rice variety will work for this recipe. Add in about a quarter cup each of moong dal, toor dal and masoor dal. Wash the rice and lentils well a couple of times. If you cannot source red rice, brown rice works perfectly too. Wash and soak the rice and lentil mixture in water for atleast an hour. Soaking the rice is important as unpolished rice needs to be soaked, so they cook to a soft texture. Heat coconut oil in a pressure cooker. Add in little cumin seeds, finely chopped garlic, finely chopped ginger, chopped curry leaves and some asafoetida. Saute for a few seconds so the spices and herbs get toasted in oil. Add the chopped onions to the pan. Add in the chopped green chillies. Saute for a few minutes till the onions are soft. Once the onions are soft, add in the turmeric powder and the red chilli powder. Saute for a few seconds for the spice powders to get roasted in oil. Add in the chopped tomatoes. Add in the salt. Salt will help the tomatoes to cook faster. Saute for a few minutes till the tomatoes are soft and mushy. We will be using about 3 cups of vegetables today. Use whatever you have in your refrigerator. I have used a combination of roughly chopped spinach, chopped carrots, chopped green beans, some potatoes – potatoes add a nice texture and flavour to your khichdi. So definitely, use some potatoes, and finally some chopped radish. The kind of vegetables you use is completely up to you. Add the veggies to the pan and mix well so the masalas coat the veggies evenly. Add in about five cups of water and mix well to combine. After mixing well, wait for the water to come to a slow boil. Once the water comes to a boil, add in the soaked and drained rice and lentil mixture. Mix once. Cover the pressure cooker and add in the weight. Cook for 20 minutes. After the first whistle, reduce the flame to low and cook for the remaining time. Ignore the number of whistles. Cooking on a low flame is important so the khichdi does not scorch at the bottom. After the said time, wait for the pressure to settle naturally. Once the pressure settles, open the cooker and mix well to combine. The rice and lentil mixture should be cooked to a soft and creamy consistency. The khichdi will slightly thicken up as it cools. Now let’s do a quick tempering for the khichdi. Heat ghee in a small kadai and add in the chopped garlic, sliced shallots and curry leaves. Saute till the shallots are golden and crisp. At this stage, switch off the flame and add in the kashmiri red chilli powder. Let the chilli powder bloom in hot oil. Add in the hot tempering to the khichdi. Our super healthy vegetable khichdi is ready. Serve hot!"

      "Heat coconut oil in a pan. Coconut oil is preferred for making this recipe. Add in a couple of cloves and a couple of cardamom to the hot oil. Add in some cumin seeds, curry leaves, minced ginger, chopped green chillies – use more or less chillies according to your taste and in the sliced shallots. Saute everything for a few minutes for the shallots to become soft. Cut the tomatoes into big chunks. Cut each tomato into 8 pieces and add to the pan. Country tomatoes give a nice taste to the kuruma. Ripe tomatoes are preferred. Add in the salt and mix well to combine. Now reduce the flame of the stove to low and cover the pan with a lid. Let the tomatoes cook for about five minutes. Make sure to saute once a while so they do not scorch at the bottom. The tomatoes should become mushy after the said time. Once the tomatoes are cooked and soft, add in a little mint leaves and the coriander leaves. Do not use the stem. Use only the leaf part. Mix well to combine and saute for a minute. In the meantime, let’s make a masala paste. Take a small chutney jar and add in the fennel seeds, Green chillies – this kuruma tastes better when it’s slightly spicy. I have used about four chillies but you can always use more or less according to what your family prefers. Add in the fresh shredded coconut, cashew nuts – cashews give a smooth texture and richness to the kuruma and finally add some pottukadalai – fried gram to the mixie. The fried gram gives little body and makes the kuruma thick. Add only a little fried gram as adding too much will make the kuruma feel doughy. Add warm water and grind to a smooth paste. Warm water will help to grind the cashews to a smooth texture. You can also soak the cashews and then grind if you have the time. Make sure to grind the paste to a smooth consistency. Add the prepared paste to our cooked tomato mixture. Wash the mixie with water and add back to the pan as you do not want to waste the masala sitting in the mixie jar. Mix well to combine. Add in more water as the kuruma will thicken up as it cooks. After adding the water, mix well to combine. Add a little sugar to balance the flavours. Cover the pan with a lid and cook for five minutes. The kuruma might foam a little. So make sure to mix well once a while so it does not overflow from the pan. If the kuruma is too thick while cooking, add little hot water to adjust the texture. The kuruma is ready when it has boiled for the said five minutes. Now, let’s make a quick tempering for the vellai kuruma. Take a small tempering kadai and add in the coconut oil. Add in the sliced shallots and the curry leaves. Roast the shallots in oil till they become crisp and golden. At this stage, switch off the flame and add in a little black pepper powder. Let the black pepper powder bloom in the hot oil. Add this tempering to our kuruma. Our fantastic thakkali vellai kuruma is ready. It goes really well with all South Indian breakfast / tiffin items."

      "Heavy duty pan is preferred for making this biryani. I am using my trusty dutch oven today for making this recipe. Add in a combination of ghee and oil to the pan. Any vegetable oil will work fine for this recipe. Add in the whole spices. a small piece of cinnamon, cloves and cardamom. Add in the sliced green chillies. Saute for a few seconds. Add in the sliced onions. Saute the onions for a good 6-8 minutes. The onions need to be sauteed well in oil till the onions are golden in colour. It’s important to take the onions to the golden colour as the flavour of caramelised onions is important for this biryani. The onions should be golden and caramelised after about 7-8 minutes. Add in the ginger garlic paste. Add in the chopped tomatoes. I have used just one big tomato for this recipe. Add in the salt. The rice will be cooked separately. So we are adding salt only for cooking the gravy at this stage. We can always add more if need be at a later stage. Add in the turmeric powder and red chilli powder. Saute for a few minutes. The tomatoes should become mushy and the mixture should look almost dry. Streaks of oil will start to appear once dry. At this stage, add in the mint leaves and the coriander leaves. Use only the leafy part and discard the stems. Saute for a minute. Add in the chicken. Mix well to combine. Add in the plain curd. Add in the water and mix well to combine. Cover the pan with a lid and cook on a low flame for 15 minutes. Do not add any extra water. The chicken will render liquid while cooking. Along with the little water we added, it should be enough to cook the chicken. Cook on a low flame so it does not scorch at the bottom. While the chicken is cooking, we will get the rice ready. Boil about three to four litres of water. Add in a tablespoon of salt to the water. When the water is boiling, add in the rice. Its better if rice is soaked for 15-20 minutes. After adding the rice, cook for 5-7 minutes till the rice is half done. The rice should easily break when pressed but still hold firm. At this stage, drain the water and set aside. The rice will continue to cook on the residual heat. Once the chicken is cooked and ready, add in the rice to the pan. Mix well to combine. The little gravy left behind from the chicken will nicely coat the rice. Add the juice of half a lime. This is optional. If the curd is sour, you can skip the lime. Now we will put the biryani on dum. Place a heavy dosa tawa on a low flame. Place the biryani pot on top of the dosa tawa. Cover the lid of the pot with a cloth and then place the lid on top. The cloth will keep the steam by insulating it inside. Cook on a low flame for 10 minutes. After 10 minutes our fluffy chicken biryani is ready to serve."

      "To this add in the grated ginger, finely chopped green chillies – alternatively, you can also crush the chillies to a paste and add. Add in the finely chopped curry leaves, black pepper powder, turmeric powder, red chilli powder, cumin seeds, asafoetida and the salt.",
      "After adding everything, mix well to combine so all the spices and herbs are evenly distributed and there are no lumps. Once the veggies and the herbs are mixed well, add in the whole wheat flour. After adding the flour, mix well and knead briefly to form a dough. Do not add any water to knead. The moisture from the vegetables will be enough to form a dough.",
      "Add a little ghee while kneading for flavour. After adding the ghee, keep kneading to form a soft dough. Add water only if the dough is very dry. Once the dough ball is formed and ready,cover the dough ball with a cloth and let it rest for five minutes. The dough will continue to soften as it rests.",
      "After five minutes, form small balls of dough. A small lime size ball will be ideal. You should be able to get about 14-16 small dough balls for this recipe.",
      "Now let’s roll the rottis. Dust a dough ball generously in flour. Regular whole wheat flour works well for dusting the dough balls. Gently roll the dough to a 6 inch circle. Since a lot of veggies is involved, you might need to be generous with the dusting flour, so the dough does not stick to the rolling stone. Be gentle with the dough so it does not tear while rolling. Gently tap off the excess flour and our rotti is ready for the griddle.",
      "Here is a small tip while rolling to avoid the dough from sticking. If you notice that the dough is sticking to the stone, take a paring knife and scrape off the dough bits sticking to the stone and to the rolling pin. This way, the dough will not stick while rolling.",
      "Place the rolled rotti on the hot griddle. Sprinkle little oil on the top of the rotti and spread evenly with the back of a spoon. Flip the rotti and sprinkle oil on the other side too. Cook for a minute. These rottis need to be cooked on a high flame so the rotti cooks fast and they maintain their moistness for a long time. The rotti is ready if it’s evenly brown on both sides.",
      "Our delicious veggie loaded masala rottis are ready. You do not need any side dish for this rotti. These can be served plain or with a side of a simple raita made with cucumber."

      "I have taken about two cups of foxtail millet flakes for making this recipe today. Place the flakes on top of a colander so the water when added can drain immediately. Add water to the flakes and wash them once. No need to soak the flakes in water. As the texture is thin, wetting the flakes in water will do. After adding the water, immediately make sure to drain all the excess water by tapping the colander. The millet flakes need to be just moist. Nothing more than that. If it absorbs a lot of moisture, it will become mushy and pasty. We do not want that. So drain the excess water completely. After draining the water, let it sit for 10-15 minutes. The flakes will rehydrate, increase in size and become fluffy during this time. The flakes would have become soft too. Our millet flakes prep is ready. Set aside.",
      "Take a wide pan and add in coconut oil. You can also add ghee if you like. Add in a small piece of cinnamon, bay leaves, cardamom, star anise, cloves, cumin seeds, curry leaves and chopped green chillies. Adjust the green chillies according to your taste. Saute for a minute for the spices to get aromatic. Add in the chopped onion. Saute the onions till they are soft. Add in the turmeric powder, red chilli powder and biryani masala powder. Ready made masala powder is fine for this recipe. Crush about 6 cloves of garlic and an inch of ginger in a mortar and pestle to a coarse paste. Add the crushed ginger and garlic to the pan. Saute for a minute for the spice powder and the ginger and garlic to nicely get roasted in oil. At this stage add in the chopped tomatoes. Add in the salt along with the tomatoes. Cook for a few minutes till the tomatoes are mushy. Once the tomatoes are mushy, add in the vegetables. Add in about 3 cups of mixed vegetables. I have used potatoes, green peas, cauliflower, green beans and carrots. Make sure to add potatoes as they give a nice texture to the pulao. Also cut all the vegetables to a fairly similar size and try to chop them small so they cook fast and they cook evenly. Feel free to mix and match the veggies according to what you can find in your refrigerator. Mix well to combine. Once the vegetables are well coated in masala, add a few tablespoons of water for the vegetables to cook. Cover the pan with a lid and cook on a low flame for seven to eight minutes. After the said time, take a small piece of potato and try to mash them. It should easily mash. If it’s hard, cook for a couple of more minutes. Once the veggies are cooked, add in the chopped mint leaves and chopped coriander leaves. Mix well to combine. No need to cook for long after adding the mint and coriander. Now, add in the rehydrated foxtail millet flakes that we made earlier. They should be soft but not mushy. After adding the flakes, gently mix well to combine. Make sure to mix in such a way that the flakes are evenly coated with the masala. Do not add any water at this stage. The moisture from the masala is just enough and will keep the flakes nice and fluffy. After mixing well, cover the pan with a lid and cook for a minute more on a low flame just to heat up the flakes. Finish the pulao by sprinkling some roasted cashews. Also add in a little ghee for aroma. At this stage, switch off the flame and cover the pan with a lid and let it rest for 15 minutes for the flavours to mingle. Our healthy and delicious millet flakes vegetable pulao is ready to be served. You can serve as is or with a side of cucumber raita."

Add in the fennel seeds and the dry red chillies. The dry red chillies are deseeded, roughly chopped and added to the hot oil. The red chilli flavours the oil when roasted and adds a nice aroma and taste to the dish. In most kongunadu style preparation, deseeded red chillies are roasted in oil for that extra punch. Add in the curry leaves.",
      "Saute for a few seconds for the spices to get roasted in the hot oil. It will turn very aromatic.",
      "Add in the sliced garlic. The small sized country garlic is preferred for this recipe. Slice the garlic into slivers and add to the recipe. Slicing it will make sure that every bite of the chicken will have a little garlic along.",
      "Add in the roughly chopped shallots. Roughly chop the shallots and add to the pan. Here is a quick tip : When you have to peel a lot of shallots like this one, soaking them for 10-15 minutes in water will help the skin of the shallots peel easily. Shallots are preferred for this recipe. They are sweeter and more flavourful than regular onions. Saute for about 5 minutes for the shallots to become soft.",
      "The shallots should turn soft and translucent after five minutes. They should also start turning slightly brown in colour.",
      "At this stage, add in the salt. Add in all the spice powders – the turmeric powder, red chilli powder, cumin powder and the coriander powder. Saute for a few seconds in the oil for the spice powders to get nicely roasted.",

      "Add in the chicken. Bone-in chicken is preferred for this recipe. The bone adds a lot of flavour to the masala while cooking. Traditionally, country chicken is used for this preparation. But regular broiler chicken works fine too. I used broiler chicken today. After adding the chicken, add about half a cup of water and mix well to combine. If using country chicken, you may want to add more water as the country chicken takes longer time to cook.",
      "Cover the pan with a lid and cook on a low flame for 20 minutes.",
      "Mix once in a while to avoid the chicken from scorching at the bottom. The moisture from the chicken and the little water we added will be more than enough for the chicken to cook.",
      "After about 20 minutes, the chicken should be completely cooked and the mixture should be almost dry, resembling a thick masala. At this stage add in the black pepper powder that’s been finely ground and some chopped curry leaves. Mix well to combine and cook for a minute more.",
      "Finally add in the chopped coriander leaves and mix well. Our Erode special Nallampatti style chicken roast is ready. This dish tastes really good with rice.",

If you are using Indian country garlic which are very small in size, you may need to use a little bit extra. To the jar, add in the dried red chillies. I have just added two. If you want a fiery stir-fry, you can always add more. But two is good for me and my family. Add in about 1/4 cup of roasted peanuts. These are roasted peanuts with the skin removed. Add in the salt. Grind this in the mixie using pulse mode. Pulse several times and stop when the powder is coarse. Its important that the powder is ground to a coarse texture. The coarse peanuts adds a nice texture to the stir fry. Once the powder is ready, set aside.",

      "Heat oil in a pan. I have used sesame oil for making this recipe today. But, any vegetable oil will work just fine. Add in little mustard seeds, cumin seeds, curry leaves and some chopped green chillies. Saute the herbs and spices for a few seconds in oil so they turn aromatic and the mustard seeds start to crackle. Add in the finely chopped onions to the pan. Saute the onions for about 3-4 minutes till the onions turn soft and slowly start to brown. Once the onions are starting to change color, add in the ginger garlic paste, finely chopped tomatoes and some chopped coriander leaves. Mix everything well to combine. Add salt to season the curry. Add about a teaspoon in the beginning and we can always adjust the seasoning later if need be. Mix again so the salt coats the tomatoes. Cover the pan with a lid and cook for about 4 to 5 minutes till the tomatoes are slightly mushy. Our tomatoes should be well cooked by this time. Take a potato masher and mash the tomato mixture. This is a cool trick to get a nice creamy gravy. The big bits of onion and tomato will become mushy and the mixture will become thick. At this stage, add in the turmeric powder, red chilli powder and coriander powder. Adjust the red chilli powder according to your taste. Remember that we also added green chillies for spice. Saute the spices for a minute. Add in half a cup of washed masoor dal to the pan. We also colloquially call this as mysore dal or mysore paruppu in Tamilnadu. Mix well to combine. Add about 2 cups of water at this stage. Cover the pan with a lid and cook on a low flame for about 15 minutes. After 15 minutes the lentils should be cooked well. Take a small piece of the cooked lentil and try to press them between your fingers. The lentil should hold its shape but is soft and cooked well. Add little water at this stage if the curry is thick. Mix well. Let it come to a boil. Once the curry is boiling, add in the eggs. I like to break the eggs in a small cup and then add it to the pan. Breaking the eggs directly in the pan somehow changes the shape and texture of the poached eggs. Also you don’t want to be searching for any accidental shell that might fall into the gravy while breaking the eggs directly onto the pan. This method is easy and works every time. Cover the pan and cook on a low flame for about 10 minutes. After 10 minutes, the eggs should be poached and our curry is ready. Gently try moving the eggs in the pan to make sure that it’s not stuck to the bottom. Be gentle on the eggs so they do not break. Finally sprinkle with coriander leaves."

      "First let’s make a masala paste for the biryani from scratch. We will be roasting all the spices and herbs in oil and then grinding them to make an aromatic biryani masala paste. Here is how to do it. Heat a tablespoon of oil in a pan. I used groundnut oil today. Any kind of vegetable oil will work just fine. Add in the spices. star anise, cinnamon, cloves, fennel seeds, coriander seeds, black pepper, cardamom, a small piece of kalpasi, and little poppy seeds. Keep the flame on low and saute the spices till they are aromatic and slightly change in colour. It will take about a couple of minutes. Add in the garlic, ginger and green chillies. Adjust the amount of green chillies according to your taste. Add in a handful of shallots along and saute them for a couple of minutes. After a couple of minutes, the masalas are roasted and ready to be ground. Transfer the ground masalas to a mixie. Add in about a quarter cup of water and grind to a smooth paste. Make sure to grind the masalas to a really fine paste.",
      "We shall be doing the biryani in a pressure cooker. Add little ghee to the pan. Add in a little oil along. Add a couple of bay leaves. Add in chopped curry leaves. Add in the sliced onions. Saute the onions till they are slightly brown in colour. It will take about 3-4 minutes on medium flame. Once the onions are slightly brown, add in the red chilli powder. Add in the turmeric powder. Saute for a few seconds. Add in the tomatoes and saute for a minute. Add in the mint leaves and the coriander leaves. Make sure to chop the leaves and then add. Saute for a minute. Add in the ground biryani masala paste. Along with the masala paste, add in plain curd / yogurt. Mix well to combine. Cover the pan with a lid and cook on a low flame for five minutes. Once the masalas are cooked, add in the chicken pieces. Always use chicken with bone in as the bone has a lot of flavours that will penetrate into the rice and make the biryani more tasty. Add in the salt. Mix well to combine. Cover the pan with a lid and cook on a low flame for 10-12 minutes. No need to add any water as the chicken will release water while cooking and that will suffice. Saute once in a while so the masalas do not scorch at the bottom. While the chicken is cooking, wash and soak the basmati rice in water for about 15 minutes. Once the chicken is cooked, add in about 3 cups of water. We used about two cups of rice today. We will have to add 1.5 cups of water for every cup of rice used. After adding the water, mix well to combine. Let it come to a boil. Once the water comes to a boil, add in juice of half a lime. Taste for seasoning at this stage and adjust for salt if necessary. Add in the soaked and drained rice at this stage and mix well. Cover the pressure pan with lid and add in the whistle weight. Cook for 5-6 minutes on medium flame or two whistles. Cook on medium flame. After the said two whistles, remove from heat and wait for the pressure to release naturally. Our Chettinadu style chicken biryani is ready. Serve hot."

Take a pressure pan ( I have used a 5 liter pressure pan) and add in the oil. Add in the bay leaves, cardamom, cloves, kalpasi, star anise and fennel seeds. Saute for a few seconds. Add a few curry leaves. Add in the sliced onions and the ginger garlic paste. Add in the green chillies. If you like a spicy pulao, adjust the green chillies according to your taste. Saute till the onions are soft. Once the onions are soft, add in the chopped tomatoes and the salt. Add in the garam masala. Mix well to combine. Cover the pan with a lid and cook till the tomatoes are mushy. Add in the mint leaves and the coriander leaves. Saute for a minute. Add in the coconut milk and the water. We have used 1.5 cups of basmati rice and 1 cup of coconut milk and 2 cups of water. Since coconut milk is a little thick, 2 cups of water is necessary for the pulao to cook. Else it might scorch at the bottom. Mix well. Let it come to a boil. Add in the soaked and drained rice to the pressure pan. Cover the pressure cooker with a lid and let it cook for 2 whistles or 5-6 minutes on a medium low flame. After the said time, remove the cooker from heat and wait for the pressure to settle. Once the pressure settles, open the cooker and mix gently. The coconut milk rice is ready.",
      "Take a pan and add in 2 tablespoons of coconut oil. Coconut oil is very flavourful and aromatic in this masala. If you do not like coconut oil, you can use any oil you like. Add in the mustard seeds, cumin seeds and the curry leaves. Saute for a few seconds. Add in the sliced onions and the ginger garlic paste. Add in the green chillies. Adjust the green chillies according to your taste. Saute till the onions are soft. Add in the turmeric powder, red chilli powder, black pepper powder, coriander powder and rock salt. Add in a little sugar to balance the taste. Saute for a few seconds. Add in the finely chopped tomatoes and finely chopped coriander leaves. Cover the pan with a lid and cook till the tomatoes are mushy. Mash with a potato masher so the tomatoes are mushy and form a thick masala. Add in the green peas. Add about half a cup of water for the green peas to cook. Cover the pan with a lid and cook till the green peas are soft. In the meantime, hard boil the eggs and set aside. peel the shell and make little gashes on the egg so the masalas can penetrate. Add the prepared eggs to the pan. Mix well to combine. Cover the pan with a lid and cook for two more minutes so the egg masala can penetrate into the egg. Finally sprinkle little coriander leaves and remove the pan from heat. Egg Masala is ready."

Finally add the rice flour little by little and knead the mixture to a soft dough. Do not add any water. Make balls out of the dough. A tennis ball size will work for the recipe. While making the balls, wet your hands in water frequently so the dough does not stick to the hands. Take a banana leaf or a parchment paper. Spread the prepped ball to a six to seven inch size roti. Use your palm to spread the roti. Wet hands frequently so the dough does not stick while spreading. After shaping the rotti, make small holes on the rotti so it cooks evenly. Heat a tawa and sprinkle a little oil. Transfer the banana leaf on the tawa. Leave it for a few seconds. Peel the banana leaf. Sprinkle little oil on the rotti. Cover the rotti with a lid and cook for a couple of minutes. Flip the rotti and cook for a minute more. Rottis are ready. Serve hot!"

A note on fenugreek seeds powder – I grind the fenugreek seeds to a powder in a mixie and add. Some households dry roast the fenugreek to golden before grinding. A classic in pickle making. I feel that raw powder works as good for this recipe. Mix the masalas well so it coats the mangoes. Cover the pan and cook on a medium flame for about 15 minutes. Keep stirring once a while so it does not scorch at the bottom. After 15 minutes, add in a tablespoon of jaggery. The jaggery adds a nice balance to the thokku. Cook for 5 minutes more. The thokku is ready after this time. The oil would have come out on the sides of the thokku. Let the mango thokku cool completely before bottling. Use a ceramic or a glass jar to store the mango thokku. I prefer to store the mango thokku in the refrigerator at all times."

Grind the soaked and drained rice for 20-30 minutes until smooth. Grind the aval / poha to a powder and add it to the grinder. Sprinkle the aval using a spoon. Do not dump at once as they may clump up. Adding aval will help in making the fluffiest idlis. Aval is an already cooked product. So it will help in better fermentation.",

If you live in a very cold place, leave your batter in some place warm. Leaving your batter inside your oven with the pilot light on works great if you live abroad and your place is cold. Once the time is up, the batter should have increased in volume. Take a ladle and mix it well. Your batter is ready. Refrigerate the batter after fermenting. Use within 4-5 days.",

Sprinkle 1/2 teaspoon of Indian sesame oil / peanut oil or ghee. Cook until underside of the dosai is golden brown, about a minute. Flip once. Cook for a few seconds.

Any green you have on hand that is not too bitter like methi or drumstick leaves will work really well for this recipe. Drain the mixture.

Add in a teaspoon of salt. While the mixture is boiling, add in the coriander leaves and simmer the saaru for 5 minutes.",

Take a bowl and add in the ground cracker meal, salt, baking powder, red chilli flakes, Italian seasoning, ghee and eggs. The baking powder will make the dumplings light and fluffy. Mix everything to form a cohesive dough. The dough will be wet. Chill the dough for 30 minutes. The dough will become firm during the rest time. After chilling the dough for 30 minutes, make small balls. Wet your hands in water and start making small balls about an inch in size. I like to keep the balls small as it will cook evenly when boiled in soup. Keep the balls in a greased plate. Chill again until we are ready to use.",

      "Step One – The first step in making this biryani is to marinate the meat",

I have used store bought biryani masala powder and store bought curry powder for this recipe. Here are the brands I like and recommend. Use whatever brand you generally use at home and its just fine. Biryani Masala Powder Curry Masala Powder",
      "Add in all the ingredients listed under chicken marination into a big bowl. Mix well to combine. Let the meat marinate for at least a couple of hours. If you have the time, cover the bowl with a lid and allow it to marinate over nite in the refrigerator. The longer you marinate, the more flavorful the meat will become.",
      "Step Two – Soaking the rice for Easy Chicken Biryani",
      "Wash and soak the rice in water before starting to cook for at-least 30 minutes. Soaking the rice helps the rice from becoming mushy when cooked. Gently wash the rice in water and soak it just before starting to cook. It would suffice.",
      "Step Three – Cooking the meat with spices, onions and tomatoes for the chicken biryani",
      "Heat oil in a heavy pan (Heavy bottomed pan is important). Make sure the pan can go in an oven and it does not have any plastic parts on the handle, lid etc.. Add in the spices and saute for a few seconds. Add in the sliced onions and saute for a few minutes till the onions are soft.",
      "Add in the tomatoes and saute for a few more minutes till the tomatoes are juicy. It will take about 3-4 minutes.",
      "Add in the marinated chicken with all the juices. Mix well to combine. Cover the pan with a lid. Keep the flame on medium and cook for around 12-15 minutes. Saute once in a while so the chicken does not scorch at the bottom. Do NOT add any water to cook the chicken. The moisture from the meat will be enough. The meat should be tender after about 12 minutes and the gravy should be thick.",
      "Step Four – Adding water and rice for making the chicken biryani We have used two cups of rice today. We will add 3.5 cups of water. After adding the water, let it come to a full boil. Its important that the water comes to a full boil. Note: This water measurement will work for oven method only.",
      "Drain the rice and add it to the pan. Let it come to a boil again.",
      "Step Five – Baking / Dum for the chicken biryani Cover the pan with a lid and place it in a preheated oven. Bake the biryani for twenty minutes at 200°C / 400°F. After the said time, remove the pan from the oven and allow it to rest for 10 minutes before opening. IMPORTANT: Place the biryani pan in the oven after the water in the pan comes to a full boil. Else the biryani wont cook properly. Also, preheat the oven 200°C / 400°F for 15-20 minutes before baking.",

      "Rice – Soak the rice for 20 minutes. Drain the water and add in 2.5 cups of fresh water. Cook for exactly 2 whistles and switch off the flame. Wait for the pressure in the cooker to settle down. It will take about 10-12 minutes for the pressure to settle. Once the pressure is off, remove the rice from the cooker and spread it on plates to completely cool.",
      "Birista – Another thing about Hyderabadi style biryani is the addition of the wonderful crispy deep fried onions called the birista or the bristha. Here is how I do it. Take about 500 grams of onions and slice it thinly. Add oil to the pan and add in the onions. Now, fried onions take anywhere between 20-25 minutes to get that deep brown colour. This is the first thing I start in the kitchen when making biryani so I can get all the other prep work done when the onions are cooking and doing its magic. The onions would slowly start to brown and change colour to a deep cocoa. Keep sauteing every couple of minutes as the onions in the corner of the pan tend to brown faster. So keep moving and mixing things. Once the onions are nice and brown, remove the onions and place it on a strainer. Press with a spatula to get rid of all the excess oil. Drain the onions on a paper towel. Set aside.",
      "Roast Cashews – We will use the same oil that is remaining after frying the onions for frying the cashew-nuts. The leftover oil is very flavorful. Add in the cashews and saute for a couple of minutes till its golden. My son loves to crunch on these cashews. So I always add a little extra. If you do not want a lot of nuts, feel free to add or reduce according to your taste. Drain the cashews on a paper towel and set aside.",
      "Saffron Water – Soak the saffron in quarter cup of really hot water. You can also soak it in milk but I like to do it in hot water.",
      "Cook the Mushrooms – Chop each mushroom into four pieces. Add in the chopped mushrooms to the pan. I have used button mushrooms today. The little oil remaining after frying cashews would suffice. If there is no leftover oil remaining, add in a teaspoon of oil. Add in quarter teaspoon of salt. The mushrooms will start to leave its moisture / water and will start to shrink. Add in the turmeric powder and the biryani masala. When the water has dried up and the mushrooms have shrunk, add in the ghee. Roast the mushrooms for 2-3 minutes till the mushrooms are charred here and there. Remove the mushrooms and set aside on a plate to cool.",
      "Biryani Gravy – In the same pan add in a tablespoon of oil. Add in the sliced onions. Saute for a couple of minutes till the onions are soft. While the onions are sauteing, take a small mixie jar and make a paste of garlic, green chillies and ginger. Add a little water to grind. If you want a spicy biryani, adjust the chillies according to your taste. Add in the chopped tomatoes and the ground ginger-garlic-green chilli paste. Wash the mixie with quarter cup of water and add it back to the pan. Add in the mint leaves and coriander leaves. Add in the biryani masala. Add a teaspoon of salt to the gravy. Store bought biryani masala usually has some amount of salt. So go easy on the salt. We can adjust the seasoning later.",
      "Cover the pan and cook for five minutes till the tomatoes are soft and mushy. Add in about 200ml of plain yogurt / curd. Whisk the curd and then add to the pan. Add quarter cup of water along. Cover the pan and cook for three – four minutes on a medium flame. Reserve quarter cup of the fried onions for garnish. Add in the rest of the fried onions / Birista to the pan. Mix well, cover the pan and let the gravy simmer for another three to four minutes until the gravy is thick. Switch off the flame and add in juice of half a lemon. Biryani gravy is done. The gravy should not be very watery. Check for seasoning at this stage and add more salt if necessary.",
      "Get all the prepped food ready. We will layer the Mushroom Dum Biryani / Hyderabadi style Mushroom Biryani. We will be doing a two parts layered biryani. So we will split all the prepped food in half and start layering. Take a bowl / pan and add in half of the biryani gravy at the bottom of the pan. Spread evenly with a spatula.

      "Thats one big “row” of biryani done. Now repeat the layering again. So two “rows” of biryani layering is done. Now the biryani is ready for DUM. The DUM can be done in several ways. I have done it in the rice cooker. Place the layered biryani in a rice cooker for 12 minutes or until the auto switch goes off. Let it rest for another 10 minutes before you serve. Stove top method – Heat a dosa tawa or a griddle. Place the prepared biryani pan on top of the griddle. Keep the flame on a low simmer and let it cook for 15 minutes. Let it rest for another 10 minutes before you serve. Oven Method – Place the biryani bowl in a preheated 200C oven for 15 minutes. Remove from the oven. Let it rest for another 10 minutes before you serve.",

      "Main Prep",
      "Wash and soak half a cup of toor dal in 1.5 cups of water for 20 minutes. Pressure cook the dal with the water for 6 whistles. Remove from heat and wait for the pressure in the cooker to release naturally. Use the back of the tumbler to mash the dal. Set the dal aside to a bowl. Add in the drumsticks. Add one cup of water. Cook for 2-3 whistles. Remove from heat and wait for the pressure in the cooker to release naturally. Set aside. Dal and drumsticks are done.",
      "Heat a teaspoon of peanut oil in a pan and add in the chana dal, coriander seeds and the cinnamon. When the dal is slightly brown, add in both the varieties of chillies. Saute for a few seconds. Remove the fried ingredients and set aside on a plate to cool.",
      "In the same pan, add in a teaspoon of peanut oil. Add in the shallots (small onions) and the chopped tomatoes. Saute for a few minutes till the tomatoes are cooked and soft.",
      "Now grind all the fried ingredients together in a mixie with half a cup of water to a smooth paste. Set aside.",
      "Other Prep Soak half a lime size tamarind in a cup of water for 20 minutes. Once the tamarind has been soaked, squeeze it between the fingers to release all the juices. Strain the juice and set aside. Discard the pith and seeds.",
      "Grind quarter cup of fresh coconut with half a cup of water to a paste. Set aside. One can also use dessicated coconut if you dont have fresh coconut. But fresh coconut is a first choice.",
      "For the main Sambar",
      "Heat peanut oil in a pan and add in the sliced small onions (Indian shallots). Saute for 2-3 minutes till the onions are soft. Add in the tamarind extract.",
      "Add in the salt, turmeric powder, sugar and jaggery. Don’t ask me why two kinds of sugar. While jaggery gives the earthy note, the sugar amps up the sweetness without overpowering.",
      "Add in the ground masala paste. Wash the mixie with a cup of water and add it to the pan. Always wash the mixie and add it to the pan so you are not wasting any of the masala that is stuck in the mixie. It is an untold rule when you are cooking Indian food. Let the sambar simmer for 10 minutes. While simmering, if you feel that the consistency is too thick or the masalas are scorching at the bottom, feel free to add a little more water.",
      "Add in the cooked dal, drumsticks and the ground coconut paste. Simmer for around 2-3 minutes. Switch off the flame.",
      "Final tempering for the darshini style sweet sambar Heat ghee in a small kadai. When the ghee is hot, add in the mustard seeds, slit green chillies, and curry leaves. Let the mustard seeds crackle. Add in a pinch of asafoetida. Add in the tempering to the sambar.",
      "Serve with idli. As they famously say here, do it “idli-dippu” style which means idlies dipped in a generous amount of sambar."

It helps in keeping the rice intact while cooking without becoming mushy. Soak the rice in water before starting to cook. Let the rice soak for 20 minutes. Drain the rice and set aside.",
      "We will need the following two pastes for the biryani. First Paste: Grind ginger, garlic and shallots to a smooth paste adding 1/4 cup of water. Second Paste: Grind Cinnamon, Cardamom, Cloves, Fennel Seeds and Green Chillies to a smooth paste adding 1/4 cup of water. If you want a spicy biryani, you can add one or two green chillies more. Adjust the spice levels according to your taste.",
      "Heat oil in a pan (and ghee if using) and add in the sliced onions and green chillies. Fry well till the onions are soft. Add in the first paste and fry for a couple of minutes. Note: The ghee is optional as the coconut milk is also rich. I add it if I make it for a party or for friends. If making at home, you can omit the ghee.",
      "Add in the second paste and fry till the mixture is dry and streaks of oil appear on top.",
      "Add in the chopped tomatoes, chopped coriander leaves and chopped mint leaves. Fry for a couple of minutes. Add in the cleaned chicken pieces and the salt. Let the chicken cook on low flame for 12-15 minutes. Keep sauteing every two minutes once to avoid the chicken from burning at the bottom. Don’t add any water. The water from the chicken will be enough to cook.",
      "Add in the coconut milk and water. The ratio of liquid to rice is one rice : 1.5 liquid. Add a combination of coconut milk (first and second pressed) and water. Add in the lemon juice. Let the liquid come to a boil. Once the liquid is boiling, drain the rice and add it to the pan. Here is how to do coconut milk.",
      "Close the pan and cook on medium flame for first whistle and on low flame for the next whistle (about 3-4 minutes). After the two whistles, switch off the flame and wait for pressure in the cooker to release naturally. Open the pan and fluff up the rice gently. Serve Pressure Cooker Chicken Biryani hot."
